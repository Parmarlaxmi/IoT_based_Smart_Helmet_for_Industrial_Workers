# IoT-based Smart Helmet for Industrial Workers

## Introduction
This project involves the development of a mining helmet designed to detect various hazardous events such as humidity, temperature, concentration of combustible gases, and other environmental parameters. The helmet continuously sends these readings to a base station PC through the cloud for monitoring. If any readings exceed their predefined limits, the helmet alerts the miner through a buzzer and sends information to the base station via IoT. This system aims to enhance worker safety and improve the working conditions in industrial environments.

## Features
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously observes environmental conditions in real-time.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Alerts workers through a buzzer and sends notifications to the base station if any parameter exceeds its limit.
- **Cloud Connectivity**: Sends sensor readings to a base station PC through the cloud for continuous monitoring.
- **Flexible Design**: Allows for the addition or removal of different sensors according to various industrial needs.
- **Easy Installation**: The system is designed for quick and easy installation.
- **Reliable and Responsive**: Provides reliable data with quick response times.

## System Components
- **Arduino UNO (Atmega328p)**: The core component of the system, responsible for reading sensor data and controlling the alert system.
- **LM-35 Temperature Sensor**: Measures the temperature.
- **MQ135 Gas Sensor**: Detects the concentration of combustible gases.
- **DHT11 Humidity Sensor**: Measures humidity levels.
- **ESP8266 ESP-01**: A Wi-Fi module used for transferring recorded data to the cloud.
- **Buzzer Module**: Alerts the worker in case of any hazardous event.

## System Requirements
- Arduino IDE for programming the Arduino UNO.
- C++ programming language for writing the code.
- Wi-Fi connectivity for the ESP8266 module to send data to the cloud.
- A base station PC for receiving and monitoring data from the helmet.

## Setup and Installation
1. **Arduino Setup**:
    - Install the Arduino IDE on your computer.
    - Connect the Arduino UNO to your computer using a USB cable.

2. **Sensor Connections**:
    - Connect the LM-35 Temperature Sensor to the Arduino.
    - Connect the MQ135 Gas Sensor to the Arduino.
    - Connect the DHT11 Humidity Sensor to the Arduino.
    - Connect the ESP8266 ESP-01 Wi-Fi module to the Arduino.
    - Connect the Buzzer Module to the Arduino.

3. **Programming the Arduino**:
    - Open the Arduino IDE.
    - Write or upload the provided C++ code to the Arduino UNO.
    - Ensure the code includes the necessary libraries for the sensors and Wi-Fi module.

4. **Cloud Setup**:
    - Set up a cloud service to receive and store data from the ESP8266 module.
    - Configure the base station PC to receive data from the cloud and display it for continuous monitoring.

5. **Testing**:
    - Test the system by placing the helmet in different environmental conditions.
    - Verify that the sensors are accurately reading the data and that the buzzer alerts when thresholds are exceeded.
    - Check that the data is being sent to the base station PC correctly.

## Usage
1. Wear the helmet and ensure it is properly fitted.
2. Power on the Arduino and ensure the Wi-Fi module is connected to the internet.
3. The helmet will begin monitoring environmental conditions and sending data to the base station PC.
4. If any hazardous condition is detected, the buzzer will sound an alert, and a notification will be sent to the base station.
